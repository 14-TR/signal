    "summary": "We’ve discovered that the gradient noise scale, a simple statistical metric, predicts the parallelizability of neural network training on a wide range of tasks. Since complex tasks tend to have noisier gradients, increasingly large batch sizes are likely to become useful in the future, removing one potential limit to further growth of AI systems. More broadly, these results show that neural network training need not be considered a mysterious art, but can be rigorized and systematized.",

    "summary": "One step towards building safe AI systems is to remove the need for humans to write goal functions, since using a simple proxy for a complex goal, or getting the complex goal a bit wrong, can lead to undesirable and even dangerous behavior. In collaboration with DeepMind’s safety team, we’ve developed an algorithm which can infer what humans want by being told which of two proposed behaviors is better.",

Second, a multiagent environment has no stable equilibrium: no matter how smart an agent is, there’s always pressure to get sma",

    "summary": "Existing code large language models (LLMs) often rely on large-scale\ninstruction data distilled from proprietary LLMs for fine-tuning, which\ntypically incurs high costs. In this paper, we explore the potential of\nsmall-scale open-source LLMs (e.g., 7B) as synthesizers for high-quality code\ninstruction data construction. We first observe that the data synthesis\ncapability of small-scale LLMs can be enhanced by training on a few superior\ndata synthesis samples from proprietary LLMs. Building on th",
