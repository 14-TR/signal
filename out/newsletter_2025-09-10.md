### Research
- COMPACT: Common-token Optimized Model Pruning Across C… [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06836v1)
  Introduces COMPACT, a pruning method jointly removing rare vocabulary tokens and channel
  parameters across tokens to reduce memory, latency, and cost while preserving standard transformer
  inference.
- Test-Time Scaling in Reasoning Models Is Not Effective… [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06861v1)
  Test-time scaling does not improve factual accuracy and increases hallucinations in knowledge-
  intensive tasks, per evaluation of 12 reasoning models on two benchmarks.
- RAFFLES: Reasoning-based Attribution of Faults for LLM… [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06822v1)
  Introduces RAFFLES, a reasoning-based method that attributes faults to specific components in
  multi-component LLM agent systems, addressing limitations of single-pass LLM-as-judge evaluations.

## Predicted Impacts
- A new pruning method (COMPACT) gives model builders a practical way to shrink LLM memory footprints and inference latency, enabling deployment on constrained devices and lowering serving costs for cloud operators.  
- OpenAI’s SafetyKit, its analysis of hallucinations, and a joint OpenAI–Anthropic safety evaluation signal that model vendors and enterprise risk teams are moving toward standardized, measurement-driven safety checks, which should speed integration of newer models into compliance‑sensitive workflows.  
- Research like RAFFLES and a negative result on test‑time scaling shows engineers building multi‑component agents or knowledge‑intensive applications need better fault‑attribution and evaluation tools, because current methods often fail to locate failures or guarantee factual accuracy.  
- New open‑source agent tooling (ADL‑CLI, Project Chimera, Windows‑Use) lowers the engineering barrier for domain‑specific agents but increases security and governance risks, so IT teams should require least‑privilege execution, comprehensive logging, and live kill‑switches before deployment.
