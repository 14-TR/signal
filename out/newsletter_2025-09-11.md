### Research
- COMPACT: Common-token Optimized Model Pruning Across C… [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06836v1)
  Proposes COMPACT, a pruning method that jointly removes rare vocabulary tokens and channel
  dimensions across tokens to reduce model size, memory use, and latency while preserving accuracy
  and retaining standard transformer layout.
- Test-Time Scaling in Reasoning Models Is Not Effective… [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06861v1)
  Test-time scaling fails to improve knowledge-intensive tasks: evaluation of 12 reasoning models on
  two benchmarks finds increased inference computation doesn't raise factual accuracy and often
  increases hallucination rates.
- RAFFLES: Reasoning-based Attribution of Faults for LLM… [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06822v1)
  Introduces RAFFLES, a reasoning-based framework that diagnoses and attributes failures across
  components of long-horizon, multi-component agentic LLM systems, improving fault localization
  beyond single-pass LLM-as-judge evaluations.

## Predicted Impacts
- Model and infra teams can use COMPACT-style pruning across channels and tokens to cut memory, latency, and serving costs, enabling more practical edge deployments and cheaper interactive services.  
- Content-moderation and compliance teams may adopt model-driven safety toolkits like OpenAI’s SafetyKit to improve detection and enforcement speed, while needing new integration and oversight practices as models evolve.  
- Engineering orgs building agents can speed production and standardize behavior by adopting spec-driven tools (e.g., ADL-CLI), which improve repeatability but require governance around YAML specs, dependencies, and testing.  
- ML practitioners deploying test-time scaling for knowledge-intensive tasks should expect limited factual improvements and higher inference cost, so current use can increase latency and expense without reliable accuracy gains.  
- Operators of multi-component agent systems will gain from reasoning-based attribution (RAFFLES) and from addressing agent identity/security gaps, both necessary to debug failures, harden deployments, and maintain user trust.
